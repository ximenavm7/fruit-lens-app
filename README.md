# Welcome to the Fruit-lens project!

Once you've cloned the repository, you must follow these steps to run the app in your computer:
* Install the app *Expo Go* on your phone
* Open up a new terminal in the repo's location
* Move to the project's folder with `cd fruit-lens`
* Install the dependencies with the following command:
 ```
    npm install
  ```
* Once the libraries have been installed, execute `npm start` to run the app
* Scan the QR code with Expo Go

That's it! You are now able to run our project :grin: :tada:
